AIRCRACK-NG TEAM
	this program automates the wep/wpa cracking process 
used by the aircrack-ng suite. the aircrack-ng team have 
made an amazing, easy to use tool and i wrote a program 
that automates their tool. grim wepa would be nothing
without aircrack-ng!!!

SANDMAN
	he showed me backtrack, taught me linux, and showed me 
everything i know about network security.

SHAMANVIRTUEL
	author of the spoonwep/spoonwpa series. i've looked
up to SV for years. he heavily influenced me, which means 
he also had a huge influence on grim wepa -- like the GUI!

EVERYONE ELSE
	suggestions, beta testing, bug reports, etc:
		okra_man, mrkazu, Weasek, mixit, hmanxx, bobdamnit
	there's others, i just can't remember right now.
	thanks to everyone that helped make grimwepa what it is now.



specifications
----------------------
all of the required/recommended apps are checked when grim wepa
is first loaded. if you are missing any of these apps, the program 
will not load, and instead will alert you which apps are missing.

	required applications:
		the aircrack-ng suite: (the body and head of grim wepa)
			-airmon-ng
			-aircrack-ng
			-airodump-ng
			-aireplay-ng
			-packetforge-ng
		
		macchanger - for client-based wep attacks
		ifconfig   - put device up/down
		iwconfig   - check for monitor mode, signing on
		sort       - for wordlist generation
		wpa_supplicant - sign on, intel4965 chipset workaround
		iwlist     - finding wpa encryption (before signing on)
	
	optional applications:
		wget   - for downloading wordlists
		tshark - strip the handshake from large capture files
		pyrit  - cracking, super-fast, gpu-style.
		crunch - generating passwords to passthrough to aircrack
		uniq   - for removing duplicates in wordlist generation
		pw-inspector - for filtering passwords (wordlist generator)

see "GUIDE" for help installing required packages



known issues
----------------------
your wireless card may not work; this is not my fault.
	- you can solve your own hardware issues using google.
pyrit in this version is 'sketchy'.
	- it cannot run in an xterm window (no visual output)
	- the dump file gets updated about every 10 min (infrequent)
	- (sometimes) waits for all input before it starts cracking,
		...meaning crunch passthrough takes a LONG time.
aircrack-ng is reported by some to be  'unstable' with large wordlists (2gb+)
intel 4965 chipset fix works for some, but not all.  (i am unable to test)
designed using aircrack-ng suite version 1.0 r1661:
	- works with aircrack-ng version 1.1
	- uses '--output-format csv' arguments with airodump-ng which is not available
		in older versions (BT3's aircrack-ng)
directories with spaces in them have been buggy in the past
	- i tried fixing this bug in this version; I think it's fixed.
users have reported problems running grim wepa using openjre as the java runtime
	- please use the java6 jre from sun!
	- to get the jre, enter into a console:
			apt-get install sun-java6-jre
	- you can open grimwepa by right-clicking the .jar file, 
			click 'Open With...', then 'Sun Java 6 Runtime'
